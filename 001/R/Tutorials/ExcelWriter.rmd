```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(xlsx)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r writer, echo=TRUE}
#Write the excel file to be used.
write.xlsx(mtcars, "mtcars.xlsx", sheetName = "cars", row.names = FALSE)

#Compute the anova equation
aov(mpg ~ cyl+disp+hp+drat+wt+qsec+vs+am+gear+carb, data=mtcars) %>% summary()


#Compute correlation
mtcars %>% cor()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
