# Map functions

Some of the workhorses in the `purrr` terminology are the map functions:

* `map()` makes a list.
* `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
* `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
* `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
* `map_chr()` makes a character vector.

Each function takes a vector as input, applies a function to each piece, 
and then returns a new vector that’s the same length (and has the same names) as the input. 

The type of the vector is determined by the suffix to the map function.

Getting our heads arounds these map functions and to use them efficiently is not trivial. Hence, bare in mind:

**The important thing is that you solve the problem that you’re working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that’s definitely something you want to strive towards!).**

```{r,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

To compute the column mean we may use the `map_dbl` as we expect a double in return. However there are 
many different ways to get the same results...

```{r, eval=1}
map_dbl(df, mean)
apply(df, 2, mean)
colMeans(df)
sapply(df, mean)
unlist(lapply(df, mean))
```

One of the nice features about the `purrr::map*` functions are that they are designed with `tidy` data and 
`tidyverse` in mind. E.g. they always take the data as first argument, they keep names, are fast, and are
consistent
```{r}
df %>% map_dbl(median)
df %>% map(.f = ~.x + 2) %>% map_dbl(mean)
df %>% map_dbl(mean, trim = 0.3)
```

For consistency, see `sapply` that attempts to `simplify` the output to an array if dimensions allow.
```{r}
sapply(df, range)
sapply(df, range, simplify = FALSE)
df %>% map(range)
```

## Fitting models

We might want to fit a model to each chunk of a dataset where the chunks are defined by specific levels of 
a variable. Here, we use the `split` function to construct a list of data where each chunk is defined by
`cyl`. We could do this as `split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)`, however, the pipe allows us to do this by:
```{r}
models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))
```
where `map` operates on each element in the list. Note the `map(df, mean)` is the same - there is this is 
just the `data.frame` (a list with equal sized vectors). The use of `~` in front of the call, is due to 
non-standard evaluation (NSE) and the `.` always refer to the current list element 
(both in `.$cyl`, where `.` is `mtcars`, and when `data = .` there it refer to the current chunk of data)

Hence, we can operate on the `models` using `map` and `map_dbl()` to extract a numeric feature about the model.
```{r, eval = 2}
models %>% map(summary) %>% map_dbl(~.$r.squared)
models %>% map(summary) %>% map_dbl("r.squared")
models %>% lapply(summary) %>% sapply("[[","r.squared")
```
The naming refer to the `cyl` levels.

### Exercise

1, 2, 5, 3, 4

## Better `safely` than sorry

The function `safely` makes it easy to catch errors that might occur unexpectedly, when we start looping
over subsets or bigger datasets than our data used to prototype or proof a concept.

We can wrap any function into `safely`, e.g. R does not know how to take the logarithm of a character, 
and it will cause an error if tried `log("a")`: `r paste(try(log("a")))`. 
```{r}
safe_log <- safely(log)
(res <- map(list(0,10,"a"), safe_log))
res %>% map_dbl(~ ifelse(is.null(.x$error), .x$result, NaN))
```
The output will always hold the two elements `result` and `error`.

The function `transpose` from `purrr` untangles the `error` and `result`
```{r}
res %>% transpose()
ok_result <- res %>% transpose() %>% .$error %>% map_lgl(is_null)
(res %>% transpose() %>% .$result)[ok_result] %>% flatten_dbl()
```
The `flatten_dbl` is similar to `unlist`, except that it is consistent in that we always gets vector of 
doubles (or an error if not the case).

Note, `transpose` declares which elements to untangle based on the first element in the list
```{r}
list(list(x = 1, b = 2, a = 3), list(x = 2, b = 4, d = 4)) %>% transpose()
```

The `possibly` function is an alternative to `safely`
```{r}
x <- list(1, 10, "a")
x %>% map_dbl(possibly(log, NA_real_))
```
where the second argument is used in case of an error.

# Mapping over more than a single argument

## Mapping over two lists

Assume that we are to simulate from a normal distribution but with different combination of means and standard
deviations
$$
(\mu_1, \sigma_1) = (5, 1)\quad (\mu_2, \sigma_2) = (10, 5)\quad (\mu_3, \sigma_3) = (-3, 10)\quad
$$
Then we would have 
```{r}
mu <- c(5, 10, -3)
sigma <- c(1, 5, 10)
```

For this task, the `map2` is handy
```{r}
map2(mu, sigma, rnorm, n = 5)
```

![maps2 calls](lists-map2.png)

What happens if `mu` and `sigma` are of different lengths you ask? It fails!
```{r, error = TRUE}
map2(c(mu, mu), sigma, rnorm, n = 5)
```

### Mapping over multiple (more than two) lists

Then we use `pmap`, it is harder to get once head around and should be used with care as
```{r}
n <- c(1, 3, 5)
args1 <- list(n, mu, sigma)
args1 %>% pmap(rnorm)
```

In this case I would prefer to use a different construct
```{r}
tibble(n = n, mu = mu, sigma = sigma) %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(norm = list(rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma))) %>% 
  pull(norm)
```

### Using different function for different parameters

If our problem suggests that different functions should be used for different parts of data or parameters,
we can use the `invoke_map` function. This allows looping over `fun` and `pars` at the same time
```{r}
f <- c("runif", "rnorm", "rpois") ## Uniform, Normal, Poisson distributions (sample from)
param <- list(
  list(min = -1, max = 1),        ## Parameters for uniform
  list(mean = -10, sd = 5),       ## Parameters for normal
  list(lambda = 10)               ## The single parameters for Poisson
)

invoke_map(f, param, n = 5)
```

### Walk

The `walk`, `walk2` and `pwalk` can be used to write files or plots to disk. 

```{r}
plots <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~ ggplot(., aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point())
```
The `plots` object contains 3 plots of the same type (the same bouiler plate is used). Because they 
are constructed using `split` and `map` we know that they have names: `r names(plots)`

```{r}
plots ## outputs the names in console
walk(plots, print) ## does the same, but quietly
```


This can be used to construct file names and save to disk
```{r}
paths <- stringr::str_c(names(plots), ".pdf")

walk2(paths, plots, ggsave) ## in the current working directory
```

## Other nice functions to known of

### keep, discard, some, every, detect, ...

```{r}
iris %>% keep(is.numeric) %>% head()
iris %>% discard(is.factor) %>% head()
```

```{r}
x <- list(1:5, letters, list(10))
x %>% some(is_character)
x %>% every(is_character)

x %>% every(is_vector) ## note that lists are themselves vectors (!)
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
y <- sample(10)
y
y %>% detect(~ . > 5)
y %>% detect_index(~ . > 5)

y %>% head_while(~ . > 5)
y %>% tail_while(~ . > 5)
```
