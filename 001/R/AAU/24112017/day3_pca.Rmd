# Principal Component Analysis

In high dimensional problems it may be hard to obtain insights from pairwise 
plots of the different variables in the data. There are ${p \choose 2} = p(p-1)/2$ combinations 
(when ignoring trivial flips of the axes). Hence, even for moderate $p$ this is an intractable
number of plots.. 

A solution is to rotate the data to obtain views of the data which contain as much information 
as possible. One criterion for "information" is *variablity*.

For two random variables $X$ and $Y$, we know that the linear combination $aX+bY$ for scalars 
$a$ and $b$ has variance given by:
$$Var(aX + bY) = a^2Var(X) + b^2Var(Y) + 2abCov(X,Y).$$

We can choose $a$ and $b$ arbitrarily, but we would like to have the variance of $aX+bY$ maximal.
In order for this to be well-defined we must limit $a$ and $b$: $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, otherwise
we could make the variance arbitrarily large. The values of $a$ and $b$ defines the rotation 
of $X$ and $Y$ holding maximum variance.

This idea is the basis of PCA - rotate the data such that the resulting components have 
maximum variance. For the next components to differ from the previous components we impose
the requirement that they are uncorrelated with the previous components.

# The best approximating low-dimensional linear surface

The PCA can also be viewed as the best linear surface approximating the data in lower 
dimension.

# Examples

## PCA analysis of `USArrest` data

First we may make a pairs plot of the data
```{r, cache=TRUE}
pairs(USArrests)
GGally::ggpairs(USArrests)
```

We see that `Murder`, `Assault` and `Rape` are somewhat correlated and more scatter
when plotting `UrbanPop` against the three measures of crimes.

We clearly see that the observations have different scales. Hence, it is 
advisable to use the correlation matrix rather than the covariance matrix 
for the PCA rotation.

```{r}
head(USArrests)
summary(USArrests)
```

Hence, we use the `scale. = TRUE` in the call to standardise (that is use the 
correlation matrix) rather than the unit based covariances 

```{r}
USArrests_pca <- prcomp(USArrests, scale. = TRUE)
USArrests_pca
plot(USArrests_pca)
```

After the PCA rotation, we can yet again make a pairs plot
```{r, cache=TRUE}
GGally::ggpairs(USArrests_pca$x %>% as_tibble())
```

We notice the null-correlations of the PCs

Proportion of variance explained
```{r}
cumsum(USArrests_pca$sdev^2)/sum(USArrests_pca$sdev^2)
```

### Biplots

Showing both the data and variables in the same plots

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.asp=1}
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(1,1,1,1)*4)
biplot(USArrests_pca, scale = 0, choices = c(1,2))
biplot(USArrests_pca, scale = 0, choices = c(1,3))
biplot(USArrests_pca, scale = 0, choices = c(2,3))

USArrests_pca_ <- prcomp(USArrests)
biplot(USArrests_pca_, scale = 0, choices = c(1,2))
```

Note, in ISLR they flip the sign of the PCs to obtain an easier interpretation of the 
PCs - however, this is merely for interpretation purposes.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
USArrests_pca$x <- -USArrests_pca$x
```

## Crabs

In the `MASS` package we have the dataset `crabs``that contain measurements on 
a specific species of crabs (Leptograpsus).

![Crabs](crabs.png)

The data contains data from 50 males and 50 female crabs of each of two subspecies: 
blue and orange.

```{r}
ccol <- function(sp) ifelse(sp=="B","#0f7fa9","#fa8d0f")
cpch <- function(sx) 1 + 15*(crabs$sex=="M")

data(crabs, package = "MASS")
pairs(select(crabs,FL:BD), col = ccol(crabs$sp), pch = cpch(crabs$crabs))
```

Let us consider a PCA rotation

```{r}
(crab_pca <- prcomp(select(crabs, FL:BD), scale. = TRUE))
crabs_pca <- predict(crab_pca) %>% as_tibble() ## Rotate the data
```

Plot the results
```{r, fig.width=11, fig.asp=1}
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = rep(4,4))
plot(crab_pca, main = "Screeplot for correlations matrix")
plot(PC1~PC2,data=crabs_pca, col=ccol(crabs$sp), pch=cpch(crabs$sex))
plot(PC1~PC2,data=crabs_pca, col=ccol(crabs$sp), pch=cpch(crabs$sex))
plot(PC2~PC3,data=crabs_pca, col=ccol(crabs$sp), pch=cpch(crabs$sex))
```
