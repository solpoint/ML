# Computational essays

http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/ 

There are basically three kinds of things [in a computational essay]:

* First, ordinary text (here in English). 
* Second, computer input. 
* And third, computer output. 

And the crucial point is that these three kinds of these all work together to express what’s being communicated.

# Rmarkdown

Interleaved R input and output together with your narative. In R we use Rmarkdown which combines [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with R input and rendered output. We can (depending on 
system install) output to html, pdf and MS Word files. This implies that we can make both static and dynamic
documents, including tables, pictures and mathematical formulae.

## Text elements

We can include the input from other files in the file hierarchy. The way to include the `markdown.Rmd` file 
below ensures that it is printed as (raw uncompiled) text.

In the list below we see the markdown (unrelated to R) syntax for the markup syntax of the most often
used formatting for simple text documents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(readr::read_file("day3_markdown.Rm"))
```


### Tables

#### `knitr`

Produces the markdown code for a table
```{r}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```

#### `DT`

```{r}
DT::datatable(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "A DT datatable (uses the DT javascript library).",
  filter = "bottom"
)

```

#### `pander`
```{r}
pander::pander(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "A pander table."
)
```

### Chunk options

The complete list is available at [Yihui Xie's webpage](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#code-decoration)

The most relevant ones are (default first):

* `eval = TRUE/FALSE`: Evaluate the code? Can also be numeric, e.g. `eval = 1:3` only evaluates the first three
lines. This can also be negative, e.g. `eval = -2` skips line two.
* `include = TRUE/FALSE`: Should the *output* be included in the document?
* `echo = TRUE/FALSE`: Should the *input* be included in the document? Can also be numeric.
* `message = TRUE/FALSE`: Should messages be included?
* `warning = TRUE/FALSE`: Should warnings be included?
* `results = 'markup', 'asis', 'hold', 'hide'`. The `'hide'` options suppress te results and `'asis'` do not 
format the output.
* `error = FALSE/TRUE`: Should errors be allowed (i.e. should be continue on error?)


Option             | Run code | Show code | Output | Plots | Messages | Warnings 
-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|----------|---------
`eval = FALSE`     | -        |           | -      | -     | -        | -
`include = FALSE`  |          | -         | -      | -     | -        | -
`echo = FALSE`     |          | -         |        |       |          |
`results = "hide"` |          |           | -      |       |          | 
`fig.show = "hide"`|          |           |        | -     |          |
`message = FALSE`  |          |           |        |       | -        |
`warning = FALSE`  |          |           |        |       |          | -

### Caching

Occationally we have parts of the code that takes very long time to run. E.g. when tuning parameters
in some data mining/machine learning algorithm it can take several hours. However, to allow such analysis
to be included in a Rmarkdown document, the `cache` option is available in Rmarkdown.

    `r chunk`{r raw_data}
    rawdata <- readr::read_csv("a_very_large_file.csv")
    `r chunk`
    
Where reading the file and process it subsequently could take a lot of time.

    `r chunk`{r processed_data, cache = TRUE}
    processed_data <- rawdata %>% 
      filter(!is.na(import_var)) %>% 
      mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))
    `r chunk`

Caching the processed_data chunk means that it will get re-run if the dplyr pipeline is changed, 
but it won’t get rerun if the `read_csv()` call changes (that is if the data changes!). 
You can avoid that problem with the `dependson` chunk option:

    `r chunk`{r processed_data, cache = TRUE, dependson = "raw_data"}
    processed_data <- rawdata %>% 
      filter(!is.na(import_var)) %>% 
      mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))
    `r chunk`

This example, and other, can highlight the importance of naming your chunks. A different example involves
appendix of code. That is, code you need in the beginning of your document, but you don't want it to jam 
up the narrative, but on the other hand it may be important to show the code later for other people.

### Appendixing

We achieve this by referring to the relevant chunk, here `"appendix"`.

    `r chunk`{r, ref.label="appendix", echo = FALSE}
    `r chunk`

And then in the end of the document we have the chunk named `appendix`

    `r chunk`{r appendix}
    some_very_complicated_function <- function(...){
       [...]
    }
    `r chunk`

### Global options

    `r chunk`{r setup, include=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, comment = NA, 
                          fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, error = TRUE)
    `r chunk`

By setting the above line in the beginning of the document, these values applies as default values for _all_ 
chunks in the document. However, all options can be overwritten locally.

### Inline code

When we want to format code in `tt`-font, we simply enclose it in ticks. If we want to output from R, 
we simply add a r in the beginning, e.g. `2+3 =` `r 2+3`

### Parameters

The use of parameters is particularly relevant for automated generated reports or documents where users
input data in e.g. a webformular (for instance using the Shiny framework in R).

For example, let the following be the header of document `report.Rmd`

    `r chunk`
    ---
    THE USUAL yaml HEADER
    
    params:
      set_title: "My title"
      set_author: "My name"
    ---

    ---
    title: `R params$set_title`                     ## NOTE: R should be r
    author: `R params$set_author`                   ##       but want compile  
    date: `R format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")`  ##       if lower case 
    ---
    `r chunk`

And on the R-side of things:

    `r chunk`{r}
    render(input = 'report.Rmd',
           params = list(
           set_title = paste("Autogenerated report on ", some_text_variable_with_topic),
           set_author = some_text_variable_with_name
                        )
          )
    `r chunk`
