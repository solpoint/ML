# Tidy data

The basic idea behind tidy data is that each row refer to an observation, each column a variable and the cells contains values.

![Tidy data schema](tidy-1.png)

Hence, of the four examples (from the book) below, only `table1` is obeying the tidy data principle

```{r}
table1
table2
table3
bind_rows(list(cases = table4a, population = table4b), .id = "type")
```

# Spreading and Gathering

Or "going from wide to long" and "going from wide to long" are two extremely important **reshaping** procedures.
These are necessary for various tasks, e.g. plotting and regression modelling may require wider data (than provided by the tidy structure).

The two functions `gather` and `spread` in `tidyr` makes this *quite* simple. 

## Gather

When using `gather` we need to provide the name of the variable (`key`) that will contain the "old" column names and the
column that will hold the corresponding cell information (`value`). The remaining `...` argument tells `gather` which columns to
gather. 

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(key = year, value = cases, `1999`:`2000`) ## note we don't need quotes, e.g. "year"
```

We can also make *negative* selection of the columns and convert the resulting columns (e.g. from character to numeric)
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(key = year, value = cases, -country, convert = TRUE)
```

## Spreading

The opposite operation of `gather` is `spread`

```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```

# Separating, Uniting and Pulling 

Occationally some variables -- in particular string variables -- contain several pieces of information that we 
would like to separate/extract into individual columns. For this `separate` and `extract` are excellent.

## Separating

The `separate` function automatically identifies the non-numeric and non-letter characters as separator(s).

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), remove = FALSE)
```

It handles different/varying separators automatically
```{r}
table3 %>% mutate(rate = paste0(year,"_",rate)) %>% select(-year) %>% 
  separate(col = rate, into = c("year","cases", "population"), remove = FALSE)
```

Using `extract` we need to do a bit more work ourselfs as this uses regular expressions.
Hence, it can cope with more advanced cases, so is only needed if `separate` can't do the job.

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  extract(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), regex = "([0-9]*)/([0-9]*)", convert = TRUE)
```

## Uniting

Strangely enough -- `unite` does the opposite of `separate`

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(cn_yr, century, year, remove = FALSE) %>% 
  unite(cnyr, century, year, sep = "")
```

## Pulling

This was obviously a misprint in the book, and is actually referring to the operation of extracting a single 
column from a tibble

```{r}
table5 %>% pull(country)
```

# Fill

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)

treatment
```

How to "complete" the `NA`s in this data? Occationally people avoids repeating
cells below if they are the same as the previous (above) value. `fill` can fix this.

```{r}
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```
